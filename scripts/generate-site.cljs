;; Generates the GitHub Pages entry points for this repo from the repo tree.

;;   index.html        -> https://kotoba-lang.github.io/kototama/
;;   docs/index.html   -> https://kotoba-lang.github.io/kototama/docs/
;;
;; Both addresses returned 404 before this existed. Pages is enabled and
;; serving (`source: {branch: main, path: /}`, `.nojekyll` at the root), so
;; every file below is already public -- there was simply no document at
;; either directory address, and no map of what is published. Individual
;; files answered 200 only if you already knew the exact filename.
;;
;; Nothing here is hand-written prose about the repo: the lead paragraph is
;; read out of README.md, every document title is that file's own `# `
;; heading, every byte count is `stat` on the real file. Editing the output
;; by hand is a mistake -- `--check` fails when the committed HTML and a
;; fresh generation disagree.
;;
;; Built on `jp-go-dds` (デジタル庁デザインシステム), the workspace's base
;; design system, per the repo-wide UI rule. The vendored `dds.css` is
;; inlined, which is how every other consumer in this workspace ships it --
;; a static page with zero external requests.
;;
;; Run:
;;   nbb --classpath "<dds>/src:<html>/src:<css>/src" scripts/generate-site.cljs
;;   nbb --classpath "..." scripts/generate-site.cljs --check
;;
;; where <dds>/<html>/<css> are the west checkouts of
;; kotoba-lang/jp-go-digital-design-system, kotoba-lang/html, kotoba-lang/css.
;;
;; Exit codes are three-valued on purpose. A generator that cannot see its
;; inputs must not return the same value as one that looked and found
;; nothing wrong:
;;   0  wrote (or verified) both documents
;;   1  a real negative finding -- drift under --check, or an input the
;;      generator refuses to publish (no documents, no payloads, a document
;;      with no readable title)
;;   2  could not run at all -- the tree or the vendored stylesheet is not
;;      where it was told to look
