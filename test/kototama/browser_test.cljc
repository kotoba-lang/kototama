  "T8.4 / kotoba-lang#356: Node :inject only where wasm-webcomponent actor-host
  actually implements a provider.

  The transport/tls/pg/scram families were `:no` here until 2026-07-31, when
  three commits flipped them after the actor-host gained the providers:
  `be65572` (transport/tls, wasm-webcomponent#17, Node corpus 16→21),
  `887a361` (pg-pool/wire/scram, #18, 21→29) and `3ae3665` (deep wire +
  SCRAM open, #19, 29→38). Each updated `host_parity_live_test` and the live
  runner but not this snapshot, so main carried five failing assertions.

  A hand-copied snapshot is what rotted, so the claim is bound to evidence
  instead: `node-inject-claims-for-the-flipped-families-are-proven-live`
  (host_parity_live_test) requires a matching case in the executed Node live
  corpus for each family named here. This test keeps only the cheap,
  network-free half."
