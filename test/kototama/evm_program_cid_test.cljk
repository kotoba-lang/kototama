  "`program-cid` on both hosts, with the CIDs written out.

  `evm_tender.cljc` is `.cljc` and could not LOAD on ClojureScript until
  2026-09-08: `program-cid` was `(format \"%02x\" (int b))`, and
  `clojure.core/format` does not exist there. Requiring the namespace under nbb
  answered `Unable to resolve symbol: format`, so an EVM program's IDENTITY was
  not computable on the runtime this workspace is migrating to.

  The CIDs below are literals rather than a cross-host comparison at runtime,
  for the same reason `cross_host_digest_test` in kotoba-lang/artifact writes
  its digests out: `(= (program-cid x) (program-cid x))` passes on one host
  alone and proves nothing about the other. Each host must independently
  reproduce the same string. They were captured from the JVM BEFORE the change
  and are unchanged by it — this makes program identity portable, it does not
  redefine it."
