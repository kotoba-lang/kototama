  "Regression coverage for `kototama.cli/cmd-run` -- previously zero (this
  namespace had no test file at all), which is exactly how a live
  capability-admission bypass on the CLI's own \"canonical execute\" path
  went unnoticed: omitting `--grant` used to auto-derive the requested
  capability set from the untrusted guest's OWN declared Wasm imports, so
  a guest could simply ask for gen-keypair/http-post/log-write and get
  them without any operator consent. `cmd-run` must require an explicit
  `--grant` for every import a guest declares; a guest asking for
  capabilities it wasn't granted must be denied, not self-served."
