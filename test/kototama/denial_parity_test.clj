  "koto-h5: the three hosts refuse the same input with the same denial.

  `kototama.denial` (koto-h6) gave every refusal one shape, but a shape that
  only the JVM tender emits is a JVM convention, not a contract. This test
  feeds ONE refusing input to every host that has the path and asserts the
  denials agree on everything in `denial/shape-keys` except
  `:kototama.tender/host` -- same reason (under both names), same refused
  value -- and that each host names itself.

  RED on the base of this change: `kototama.browser/admit-host!` threw a bare
  `{:kototama.host/code :host-surface-rejected}` for :jvm and :browser alike
  (no reason, no value, no host), and the JVM tender had no `:invalid-budget`
  path at all -- a `:fuel -1` reached Chicory and every instruction was
  'over budget' from the first, so it surfaced as `:fuel-exhausted` on a
  budget that never existed, while the EVM tender refused `:gas -1` before
  running. Two hosts, two answers to one wrong input."
