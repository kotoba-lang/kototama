;; Validates every qualification/implementation-declaration-*.edn against the
;; :conformance :implementation-declaration schema in spec/kototama-vm-v1.edn.
;; seq-3 follow-up: the declaration was standalone in qualification/; no test
;; validated it against the spec schema. This closes that gap.
;;
;; FINDING (2026-09-08, this test's first run): the two declarations drifted in
;; shape — amu-evm used :profiles as a vector of {:profile k ...} maps and
;; :spec as a keyword; kototama-evm-tender used :profiles as a {profile->map}
;; map and :spec as a spec-reference map. The spec schema did not pin
;; :profiles/:spec shape, so both satisfied the letter of the schema while
;; having incompatible shapes.
;;
;; TIGHTENED (seq-9, same day): spec/kototama-vm-v1.edn :conformance
;; :implementation-declaration now pins :profiles-shape :keyed-map and
;; :spec-shape :reference-map. Both declarations were migrated to the keyed
;; map + spec-reference-map shapes; bare-keyword :spec and vector :profiles
;; are now non-conformant and this test enforces it.
;;
;; 8-question Q1: an empty declaration set must FAIL, not pass vacuously.
