  "What survives an unreliable transport, and what does not.

  Superproject ADR-2608170400 P5-4 asks for tests over transport loss,
  duplicate delivery, reordering and replay, and asks specifically that
  idempotency and exactly-once not be conflated. This namespace exists to keep
  them apart with evidence rather than with a sentence, because the two are
  easy to confuse in a stack built on content addressing: writes really are
  idempotent, and it is tempting to read that as delivery being exactly-once.

  `linear-journal`'s own docstring already says the sharp part -- *content
  addressing is not idempotence; the CID does not stop a second execution* --
  and the three properties below are what the implementation actually
  provides. The third is a negative result and is the point of the file."
