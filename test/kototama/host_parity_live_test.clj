;; The five families that moved from `:no` to `:inject` on 2026-07-31
;; (be65572 / 887a361 / 3ae3665) are the ones whose honesty snapshot in
;; browser_test went stale. Binding them to the EXECUTED Node corpus is what
;; that snapshot could not do: this fails if the corpus stops proving a family
;; while `host-impl` still claims it can inject.
;;
;; The join is by the corpus' own id convention, `<import>-node-...`. It is
;; deliberately applied only to these five: a sweep over every `:node :inject`
;; row reports 21 imports with no matching case id today, and until each is
;; checked by hand that number is as likely to be a naming mismatch in this
;; join as a missing proof. See kototama#127.
