(ns kototama.identity
  "kototama.identity — self-issued identity for atproto actors + artificial organisms.

  The workspace model (root CLAUDE.md): an actor holds its OWN Ed25519 key → its
  key-derived name IS its graph → it is structurally authorized to self-mint/publish
  (no operator, no token, no owner hand-off). This ns is the KEY-MATERIAL half of that
  model — Ed25519 keygen (JVM/bb; java.security, verified to run under babashka) and the
  non-secret public record. The did:key ENCODING lives in `kototama.didkey` (we reuse it,
  not duplicate it).

  SECURITY: the private key NEVER touches git. Callers persist it under a gitignored
  path (e.g. `.<actor>/identity.edn`) or an IPFS keystore key — this ns only computes the
  public identity (did:key) and packages the non-secret record."
