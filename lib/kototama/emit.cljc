  drainer + member-submit. An organism builds an AT-Proto `app.bsky.feed.post`
  record and wraps it in a member-sign-ready ENVELOPE; it never holds a key and
  never asserts `:published` — the member (or the kotoba node under the member's
  CACAO leash) signs, and the return is a member-attributed `:receipt`.

  Targets are surfaces like app-aozora (the yoro feed reader/poster) and
