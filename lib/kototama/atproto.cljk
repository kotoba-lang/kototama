(ns kototama.atproto
  "kototama.atproto — the shared AT-Protocol surface for atproto actors + artificial
  organisms. Promoted from the etzhayyim kanjō cell (ADR-0002) to the one portable home,
  generalized so any actor parameterizes it with its own DID / handle / record NSID.

  Pure, deterministic, dependency-free (only `kototama.gates` + clojure.string): runs under
  bb/JVM today, and the scalar subset under the kototama wasm runtime via ACTOR_PRELUDE.
  No clock, no PRNG in the pure path — `created-at` is passed IN and the record key is a
  CONTENT hash, so the same input always yields the same record (resume-safe).

  The membrane rule: every machine-composed outward TEXT passes `gates/assert-no-advice`
  before it can become a post — observations only, never advice / valuation / forecast."
