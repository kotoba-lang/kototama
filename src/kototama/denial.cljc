(ns kototama.denial
  "One shape for every policy denial a kototama host raises (koto-h6).

   Before this namespace the tender's denials came in four shapes --
   `{:kototama.tender/problem k}` for most refusals,
   `{:kototama.tender/denied id :kototama.tender/reason k}` for a host
   import a guest was never granted, `{:kototama.tender/rejected ..
   :kototama.tender/errors ..}` for a rejected import surface, and
   `{:kototama.host/code k}` from the browser admission -- so a reader had
   to know which path a denial came from before it could tell a denial
   from a bug. Every denial now carries the same four keys:

     :kototama.tender/problem  the reason keyword (the name every
                               external reader already pins -- sahai and
                               fleet store tests read
                               [:error :kototama.tender/problem])
     :kototama.tender/reason   the same keyword (koto-h6's name for it)
     :kototama.tender/value    the offending value -- what was asked for
                               and refused (an import id, a deadline, a
                               requested surface, an instruction count)
     :kototama.tender/host     which host refused: :jvm | :browser | :evm

   plus whatever detail the path adds (`:kototama.tender/fuel-limit`,
   `:kototama.tender/errors`, ...). The historical keys of the four old
   shapes are kept BESIDE these by their callers, not here.

   The key namespace is `kototama.tender` on every host because `tender`
   names the ROLE (ADR-2607022400), which the browser and EVM hosts also
   discharge -- `kototama.tender` the namespace is one implementation of
   it.

   Fail-closed on its own vocabulary: a reason that is not in `reasons`
   is a caller bug and `denial` throws on it instead of minting a
   denial nobody registered. `reasons` is the enumeration a test can walk."
