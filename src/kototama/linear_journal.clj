  "Durable at-most-once capability consumption journal — a parent-linked
  chain of content-addressed entries.

  The at-most-once property is unchanged and is still the point: one claim is
  fsynced before the provider runs, so a crash may consume authority without
  producing a result, but recovery can never replay it.

  What is new is that an entry has an **identity**. Each appended line is
  addressed by the raw CIDv1 of its own bytes, and carries `:prev`, the CID
  of the line before it. Root ADR-2608160200 asks for receipts that are
  values rather than lines, for two reasons a plain append log cannot serve:

  - a transaction elsewhere can then **cite** the consumption that authorised
    it, by CID, instead of by \"trust the file\";
  - truncation and edits stop being invisible. Appending is the only edit an
    append log detects; a chain detects a middle entry being changed, and
    `verify-chain` says where.

  **Content addressing is not idempotence.** The CID does not stop a second
  execution — the file lock, the fsync and the count do. Nothing about the
  linear guarantee moved into the hash.

  The CID is `raw` (0x55) over the exact bytes of the line, so any tool can
  verify it (`ipfs add --raw-leaves` agrees) without this file teaching it a
  schema. dag-cbor would additionally let generic tooling read the fields,
  and is the follow-up when a consumer needs that; it would pull a CBOR
  dependency into a repo that keeps `kototama.contract` and `lib/*`
  zero-dep, which is not worth paying before there is a reader.

  **Entries written before this** carry no `:prev`. They are reported as an
  unchained prefix rather than as corruption: a journal that predates the
  chain is not a broken chain, and calling it one would make the check
  useless on every journal that already exists."
