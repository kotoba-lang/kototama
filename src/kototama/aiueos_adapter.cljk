  "The 'aiueos decides, kototama enforces' loop ADR-2607062330's follow-up
  (and ADR-2607062330 addendum 6) left open: translates a REAL aiueos
  policy decision into a `kototama.contract/host-caps` value, instead of
  every `kototama.tender` caller hand-building `HostCaps` in a test.

  aiueos's own decision entry point is `aiueos.decide` (ADR-2607022700's
  decision-subprocess design): a process a native host adapter shells out
  to via `bb decide`, reading/writing newline-delimited EDN. That subprocess
  wrapper exists for host adapters that can't or don't want a JVM/Clojure
  dependency on aiueos directly (a Rust or Node tender, say). `kototama`
  IS already JVM/Clojure, and `aiueos.decide/handle-request` is documented
  as \"Pure aside from the contract lookup -- no stdio -- so it's directly
  testable without a subprocess\" -- so this adapter calls `aiueos.cli/
  command-result` (what `handle-request` itself calls, one layer down,
  skipping the EDN-line marshaling a subprocess boundary needs but an
  in-process call doesn't) directly, as a real `io.github.kotoba-lang/
  aiueos` dependency, rather than spawning `bb decide` per decision. This
  is still `aiueos.decide!`'s and `aiueos.cli/command-result`'s decision --
  this adapter only translates the answer, exactly as the deferred
  follow-up specified -- not a second, kototama-owned decision algorithm,
  and not a code-level merge of the two execution namespaces (kototama.
  tender still never decides a grant itself; ADR-2607022700's rule)."
