;; Until 2026-09-07 both commands returned a literal {:ok? true} after
;; pretty-printing a report, so `clojure -M:doctor` (the R1 gate named in
;; docs/maturity.md) and `clojure -M:cli parity` (the R2 gate) had never
;; produced a red. Every check below yields :pass, :fail or :unmeasured;
;; :unmeasured ("could not run", e.g. a fixture file absent) is neither a
;; pass nor a fail and maps to exit 2 in `exit-code`.
