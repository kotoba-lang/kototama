  Until 2026-08-22 this file only asked whether a boundary HAD a version or a
  git-sha, never whether it named the one actually on the classpath. Measured
  that day, three of the six recorded pins were wrong -- `security` and `abi`
  had drifted, and `aiueos` named a SHA that deps.edn had not pinned for
  weeks -- and the suite was green throughout, because a recorded pin and a
  resolved pin were never compared.

  `:external-to-deps true` marks the boundaries that genuinely are not
  Clojure dependencies (the workerd binary, the JDK). It is required rather
  than inferred from absence: without it, a coordinate with a typo in it
  would be absent from deps.edn for the wrong reason and skip this check
  looking exactly like workerd."
