  "An execution is a value, and its CID is a cache key only sometimes.

  Root ADR-2608160200: `{program, input, state, runtime, policy, effects} →
  CID`. `amu` already does this for builds — a sealed output set with signed
  provenance — and this is the runtime half.

  **The CID is always an identity and only sometimes a memo key.** That
  distinction is the whole namespace. `same program, same input, therefore
  same result` is true for a pure computation and false for anything that
  read a clock, a random source or the network, and a cache that cannot tell
  them apart is a cache that never notices the world changed. So:

  - `execution-cid` always answers. It is what a transaction cites.
  - `memo-key` answers **nil** unless the execution is replayable, and the
    caller cannot get a key without going through it.

  Two functions rather than a flag because a flag is easy to ignore.

  ## What makes an execution replayable

  An effect is replayable when the log carries enough to reproduce it
  without performing it again:

  - a **source** (clock, randomness, a network read) must have its *value*
    recorded. An outcome of `:ok` says the call happened, not what it
    returned, and replaying against `:ok` invents the answer.
  - a **sink** (a write, a publish) must have an outcome recorded, so replay
    knows whether to consider it done.
  - an effect whose kind is **not classified at all** refuses the memo. This
    is `capability-semantics.edn`'s `:unknown-kind :deny` applied here: the
    conservative direction is the one where an unrecognised effect cannot
    silently become cacheable by being unfamiliar.

  The classification is passed in, not hardcoded, because the vocabulary of
  effect kinds belongs to `kotoba-lang`'s `lang/capability-semantics.edn`
  and a second copy here would drift from it.

  ## Receipts

  A receipt is what `capability-semantics.edn` requires —
  `:receipt/cap`, `:receipt/at`, `:receipt/call`, `:receipt/outcome` — plus
  `:receipt/value` for a source. `kototama.linear-journal` chains
  consumption entries; those are not yet these receipts, and this namespace
  does not pretend otherwise: it reads whatever receipts it is handed."

  the identity would make every run unique and the CID useless."
