(ns kototama.evm-tender
  "An EVM tender: the tender role, discharged over EVM bytecode.

  `kototama.tender`'s own docstring says the role is not the engine -- that
  namespace is *one* implementation, JVM/Chicory over Wasm. This is a second
  one, over `kotoba.vm.evm`. The spec has said so since it was written:
  `:evm/v1` sits beside `:core/v1` in `spec/kototama-vm-v1.edn`, and
  `:core-is-not-automatically-evm-compatible true` means the profile has to be
  discharged by something, not inherited.

  ## Three things this plane gets for free that the Wasm plane works for

  **1. No ambient authority, by construction.** EVM bytecode has no import
  section. There is no `actor:host` field for it to name, so there is nothing
  to deny -- a contract cannot reach a clock, a socket or a key because the
  instruction set has no opcode that does. `kototama.contract` is still the
  authority vocabulary here (reused verbatim, never forked), but for a pure
  EVM execution the granted set is empty and that is the *default*, not a
  configuration. Host reach, when it is eventually wanted, must arrive as an
  explicitly granted capability rather than be subtracted from an ambient one.

  **2. Resource exhaustion is already a value.** The spec says
  `:resource-exhaustion {:outcome :value :must-not :uncatchable-host-trap}`.
  `kototama.tender` satisfies this only at the `run-report` boundary -- its
  fuel listener throws from inside execution and the outer catch converts it.
  The EVM machine returns `{:status :invalid :invalid-reason \"out of gas\"}`
  as an ordinary value; there is no throw to convert.

  **3. It is portable.** This namespace is `.cljc` with no host imports, so
  the plane runs wherever `kotoba.vm.evm` runs -- JVM and nbb both.
  `kototama.tender` is `.clj`, pinned to Chicory and therefore to the JVM.

  ## What this deliberately does NOT claim

  `:floating-evm-claim-forbidden true`. This namespace discharges the
  *tender role* over EVM bytecode; it does not by itself earn any `:evm/v1`
  level. Levels are earned by the suites the spec names
  (`:ethereum-general-state-tests`, `:differential-execution`), and the
  standing declaration in `qualification/` is what states the current status.
  See `qualification/implementation-declaration-kototama-evm-tender.edn`."

(def gas-mapping
  "How this tender relates the spec's `budget` to the EVM's `gas`.

  `:fevm/v1` requires `{:gas {:meter :filecoin :ethereum-gas-equality false
  :mapping-version-required true}}` -- a mapping must be *named and
  versioned*, not implied. The same discipline is applied at `:evm/v1`,
  because the confusion it guards against is present here too:
  `kototama.tender`'s `:fuel` counts Wasm *instructions* and the EVM's gas is
  a priced schedule. They are different quantities that both answer to the
  word budget, and silently treating one as the other is how a budget stops
  meaning anything.

  This mapping is deliberately the identity: a caller's budget IS EVM gas,
  charged on the Paris schedule. That is a claim, so it is versioned and can
  be superseded rather than drifted."
