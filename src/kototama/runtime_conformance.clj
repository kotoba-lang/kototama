  "Differential execution against Chicory and independent Wasmtime/Node
   engines. This is qualification code; it never participates in admission.

   Every engine result is one of three shapes, and the comparison keeps them
   apart:

     {:ok? true  :result n}                         ran to completion
     {:ok? false :trap-kind <pinned kind> ...}      the engine trapped, and
                                                    the trap is one we recognise
     {:ok? false :trap-kind :tool-failure ...}      the engine could not be
                                                    asked (binary missing, bad
                                                    flag, unparseable output)
     {:ok? false :trap-kind :unclassified-trap ...} it trapped, but not with a
                                                    literal pinned below

   Before 2026-09-07 `compare-main` called it a shared :trap whenever all
   three engines returned :ok? false FOR ANY REASON, so a `wasmtime` invoked
   with a bad flag (exit 2, \"unexpected argument\") passed the division-trap
   case as green. Measured on this tree: {:ok? true :mode :trap}. A trap is
   now only agreed when every engine reports the SAME pinned :trap-kind; any
   :tool-failure or :unclassified-trap makes the run :unmeasured, which is
   :ok? false -- \"could not compare\" is not \"compared and agreed\".

   The literals are pinned on purpose: an engine renaming its trap message
   turns this red, and that red is the assertion working (the same shape
   root CLAUDE.md records for the :spki-pin-mismatch -> :peer-not-pinned
   rename)."
