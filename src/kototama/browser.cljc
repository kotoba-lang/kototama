  "R2: browser-native host parity matrix vs kototama.tender (JVM).

   Pure data — no DOM, no Wasm. Documents what
   kotoba-lang/wasm-webcomponent `actor-host.js` implements synchronously
   vs what the JVM tender implements. Used by doctor / maturity report.

   Honest gaps:
   - http-post: real in a browser tab as of wasm-webcomponent PR #8
     (2026-07-16) -- a SharedArrayBuffer+Atomics.wait bridge
     (http-post-bridge.js's createSabHttpPostBridge), but only inside a
     cross-origin-isolated page (COOP/COEP headers) with the guest
     instantiated in a dedicated Worker (Atomics.wait is disallowed on the
     main/DOM thread) -- see kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js /
     kotoba-wasm-worker-element.js and
     test/browser/verify_http_post_browser.cljs there for the real,
     verified end-to-end path
   - llm-infer: real in a browser tab as of wasm-webcomponent PR #11
     (2026-07-16) -- reuses the SAME Worker+SAB+Atomics bridge http-post
     proved out (kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js passes ONE bridge instance as
     both httpPostBridge and llmInferBridge). NOT a direct call to a real
     LLM provider, though: a browser tab can never hold a provider API key
     without shipping it to every visitor, so this requires a
     developer-controlled proxy URL (llmInferUrl) that itself holds any
     real credential server-side -- see
     test/browser/verify_llm_infer_browser.cljs there.
   - http-fetch/http-post-headers: real as of wasm-webcomponent PR #15
     (2026-07-26), using the same injected or SAB+Worker network transport,
     exact JVM ABI shapes, independent quotas and the shared session authority.
   - kgraph-*: separate surface (kgraph.js), not actor:host"
