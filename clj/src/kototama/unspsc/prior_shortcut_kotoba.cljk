(ns kototama.unspsc.prior-shortcut-kotoba
  "A verified, drop-in-compatible alternative to
  `kototama.unspsc.life/prior-shortcut?`, decided by the compiled
  `.kotoba`/WASM module (`resources/prior_shortcut.wasm`, compiled from
  `wasm/prior_shortcut.kotoba` -- see `wasm/README.md`) instead of
  in-process Clojure. ADR-2607151500's kotoba-lang-org-internal narrow-
  slice port, wired up as an available function -- but NOT swapped in as
  `kototama.unspsc.organism`'s actual default (that's a live production
  fleet decision-gate and deserves an explicit owner decision, not an
  autonomous substitution).

  Kept in its OWN namespace (JVM-only `.clj`, not `.cljc` -- Chicory has
  no ClojureScript story), same isolation pattern `langchain.jvm`/
  `langchain.kotobase-persist` already use for optional backends: Chicory
  stays out of this repo's main `:deps` (see `clj/deps.edn`'s comment),
  so requiring `kototama.unspsc.life` or `.organism` never forces it on a
  consumer who doesn't want the WASM-backed variant. Add Chicory to your
  own project's deps to use this namespace."
