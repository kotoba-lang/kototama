  "Phase 2 enrichment tooling — fills the per-commodity spec/risk/description for
  codes that have none, so every one of the 18,342 actors is richly functional.

  The enrichment DATA is generated at build time by Haiku sub-agents (analogous
  to the original Gemini batch, ADR-2605171300) — NOT by a religious-corp runtime
  path, so the Murakumo-only inference invariant (ADR-2605215000) is preserved:
  the actor's runtime `reason` node stays Murakumo-only.

  Two entry points:
    dump-needs  — write the codes lacking spec-fields to data/needs-enrichment.jsonl
                  (batched lines {code,title,segment,family} for the sub-agents)
    merge       — overlay generated enrichment (data/enrichment/*.json) onto the
                  taxonomy EDN and rewrite resources/unspsc-taxonomy.edn"
