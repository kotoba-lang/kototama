(def ^:private literal-controls

  Not because `pr-str` escapes them inside strings — it does — but because
  this function takes TEXT, and the whitespace between forms in a
  pretty-printed artefact is raw code 9/10/13 that no writer touched.
  Escaping it destroys the document."
  #{9 10 13})

(defn escape-controls
  "Replace every control character in `text` with its `\\uXXXX` escape,
  except tab, newline and carriage return.

  ## Why the writer and not a checker

  A single raw control byte makes `file(1)` classify a file as `data`, and
  grep then **skips it silently**: `grep -c somename <file>` prints nothing
  and exits 1 — exactly what a file not containing that name does. Every
  search-based conclusion about that file is void and nothing says so.

  Measured 2026-08-18 across this workspace: **20 source and resource files**
  held raw NUL bytes, and every one of them was there on purpose — a sentinel
  in a two-pass replace, the start of a regex character range, SQLite magic
  bytes, a domain separator in a hash input. Three of the twenty were
  `.kir.edn`, this workspace's canonical IR, and the code they encode is
  *the null-byte check itself*.

  They were there on purpose because **`pr-str` emits the raw byte**:
  `(pr-str (str \"a\" (char 0) \"b\"))` is the five bytes `34 97 0 98 34`. It
  round-trips, so it is semantically canonical and textually binary.

  A gate that finds these afterwards leaves a window. A writer that cannot
  emit one closes it. So this lives here, and the gate becomes a backstop for
  text that arrived from somewhere else — which is what backstops are for.

  ## Why this cannot move a CID

  Identity is over the **value**, and `\\u0000` reads back as the same
  character, so `read-string` returns an equal value either way. Escaping is a
  property of the text projection, not of the thing projected. Where something
  hashes text bytes rather than a value, that is a different decision and this
  function is not it — pin the digest and prove it, the way
  `kotoba-lang/rdf-canon` and `kotoba-lang/occupation` did.

  Total and idempotent: no input produces a raw control byte in the output,
  and escaping already-escaped text is a no-op.

  ## Why this is public and not folded into `write-string` alone

  `write-string` is one writer with a one-line shape and a byte bound.
  Generated artefacts are written by other writers with other shapes —
  `clojure.pprint/pprint` for a checked-in KIR file, where the multi-line
  layout IS the point and a single line would be useless. Measured
  2026-08-19: `pprint` emits the raw byte exactly as `pr-str` does
  (`[123 58 115 32 34 97 0 98 34 125 10]`).

  Those writers need the escaping rule and not this writer. Handing them the
  function is one definition; leaving them to reimplement it is two that can
  disagree, which is the defect this library exists to remove."
