;;
;; The ClojureScript half of this repository's suite. It had none until
;; 2026-09-08, while shipping 10 `.cljc` sources -- so every one of those was a
;; portability claim no run had ever checked, in the repository that IS the
;; runtime this workspace is migrating toward.
;;
;; `kototama.tender` and the Chicory path are deliberately untouched by this
;; file. They are `.clj`, they are the JVM Wasm runtime the migration contract
;; freezes (90-docs/migration/kotoba-wasm-runtime-cutover.edn), and porting
;; them is tranche T1, not a test-registration change.
;;
;; TWO test namespaces are absent for reasons that are NOT "nobody got to it",
;; and the distinction is what this file is for:
;;
;;   evm-tender-test        reads `spec/kototama-vm-v1.edn` off disk through
;;                          `clojure.java.io` and `slurp`. Genuinely JVM-only.
;;
;;   denial-parity-test     requires `kototama.evm-tender`, and THAT SOURCE
;;                          CANNOT LOAD HERE. `evm_tender.cljc` is `.cljc` --
;;                          it claims both hosts -- and line 100 is
;;                          `(map #(format "%02x" (int %)) code)`.
;;                          `clojure.core/format` does not exist in
;;                          ClojureScript, so requiring the namespace throws
;;                          `Unable to resolve symbol: format` before anything
;;                          runs. Measured 2026-09-08 by requiring it directly
;;                          under nbb.
;;
;;                          That is a finding about the SOURCE, not about the
;;                          test: an EVM-tender CID is computed from a hex
;;                          rendering of code bytes, and the rendering is
;;                          JVM-only. It is also exactly the byte-formatting
;;                          shape `verify-cljc-runtime-parity` warns about.
;;                          Fixing it is a change to `evm_tender.cljc` with its
;;                          own evidence, not a test-registration change, so it
;;                          is reported rather than worked around here.
;;
;; Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below. Being
;; required is not being run;
;; `scripts/verify-cljs-runner-completeness.cljs` in the superproject measures
;; this file against the directory and will say so.
